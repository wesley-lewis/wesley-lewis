## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Low Level Software Engineer who loves figuring out software from their implementation and their ideas.

Why?

Without implemenation I'm a donkey, without ideas I'm a donkey - (By me)

Diving deep into software and systems gives me a unique ability to understand from the bottom level and then try to again interpret from the top level. Switching from 1 feet view to 10000 feet view is a good skill to learn - (Trust me)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building Source Code Analysis Tools @ [Asvatthi](https://asvatthi.com)

  At Asvatthi I've gotten my hands on working with Language Grammars and building frontend parsers for 6 languages and helped junior team members to build their own!
  I've built the following parsers:
  * Python (Simple grammar with 35 keywords)
  * Java (Moderate grammar with 68 keywords)
  * Javascript (Moderate grammar, a bit difficult to work with tho with 63 keywords)
  * Rust (Moderate grammar, with 40 keywords. Building a parser in Rust for Rust was fun)
  * Go
  * C++


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the following topic: 

    * LLVM IR. Compiler backends are just a whole new world.

    * git internals to be able to add some features to the Git system

    * I'm also diving into WM and making my own environment that I can copy in different Linux distributions. I have done a bit of distro hoping starting with fedora, then Arch, then Debian then Manjaro and now currently I use OpenSUSE Tumbleweed (yes, the Chameleon guys). I do like Tumbleweed for it's near frequent updates that comes along with stability which is such a strong combination

    * Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on package management software. I've started researching on RPM and looking at the codebase of Zypper
